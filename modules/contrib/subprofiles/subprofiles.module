 * @file
 * Provides ability for installation profiles to provide subprofiles--
 * variations of the main profile.
 *
 * Subprofiles are defined in the profile's .info file in the following format:
 * <code>
 * // Name and description of the subprofile. A "standard" subprofile is
 * // required and is used by default if no subprofile is selected.
 * subprofiles[standard][name] = My Profile standard
 * subprofiles[standard][description] = Install a full version of My Profile with all commonly needed modules enabled.
 * // A feature called feature_x that should be enabled by default.
 * subprofiles[standard][modules][feature_x] = TRUE
 * subprofiles[standard][modules][feature_y] = TRUE
 * // A feature called feature_z that should be available but disabled by
 * // default.
 * subprofiles[standard][modules][feature_z] = FALSE
 * </code>
 *
 * For interactive installs, the subprofile can be selected on the site
 * information page. For automated installs, the subprofile can be passed in
 * as a parameter along with the profile. If no subprofile is specified,
 * the 'standard' one is used.
 *
 * Subprofiles also provides a drush command, subprofiles-install-site, which
 * can be used to install a site with a specified profile and subprofile.
